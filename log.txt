- I moved the OS out of the computie repository and into its own, with the git history preserved
- It will now be known as gloworm, named after the 1980s toy, since my Rust OS was already named Ruxpin after Teddy Ruxpin, so I
  tried to stick to the same theme

- the previous time I was working on in this repository was November/December 2023 when I tried to get the monitor and kernel
  compiled in clang, and booted it using Moa.  I ran into the common bug where the MOVEA instruction is assumed to set the flags
  register, but it's the one exception where the flags don't get updated, so a comparison doesn't work.  And it usually affects the
  fputs implementation causing it to print all of memory starting with the welcome message, but never terminating at the null
  character.  I never got around to submitting a bug report
- I've started working on this again since Christmas when I built the k30p-VME, MemBird Woodcock, and CF Card.  I added some commands
  to the monitor to test the VME bus accesses, and test the CF card, and I've since managed to get the kernel booting on the k30p
  and run the network stack
