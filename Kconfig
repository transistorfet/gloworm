config SHELL_IN_KERNEL
	bool "Include the `init` and `sh` code in the kernel binary"
	help
	  This will compile the init process and shell, along with some
	  utilities such as cat, cp, mv, ps, mount, kill, date, and so on, into
	  one binary blob.  The kernel will start the first process and call
	  the init function instead of trying to load the init elf file from
	  the file system.  The init process will create the first shell
	  process and the shell will launch the utilities that are built-in
	  the same way, and any non-built-in commands will be run as normal,
	  by attempting to load an elf executable from the file system.  This
	  option is handy when sending the kernel over serial, to a computer
	  running the monitor from ROM, when no secondary storage is available
	  or when it's not working correctly.

config SHELL_WITH_UTILS
	bool "Include the some basic /bin utilities in the shell"
	help
	  This will compile some utilities such as cat, cp, mv, ps, mount,
	  kill, date, and so on, into a single elf.  The commands that are
	  included will be run in a separate process using the same read-only
	  memory area.  Any non-built-in commands will be run as normal, by
	  attempting to load an elf executable from the file system.
